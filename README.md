# KMNIST CNN Modeling Training and Streamlit App

## What is [KMNIST](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist)?
KMNIST - short for Kuzushiji-MNIST - is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset. Instead of numbers, this dataset is made out of 10 hiragana characters!

## Objective of this project
1. Learn the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Streamlit ‚è´
2. Train, validate, and test a CNN that can detect a user-drawn character üî•
3. Create a simple interactive web app using Streamlit to allow users to draw a character and have the model make a prediction ü§ñ

## How the app looks (there is a demo video as well!)
